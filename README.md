# Drum Kit

In order to learn about the more intermediate/advanced parts of the DOM, I created this drum kit website.

## How to play
I've added EventListeners to buttons and keystrokes. This way you get different drum sounds by either clicking the corresponding button or key on your keyboard.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/zangelis/drum-kit.git
cd drum-kit
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from index.html and paste it into the search bar.
